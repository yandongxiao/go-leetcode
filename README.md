# go-leetcode

A collection of 100+ popular [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems that I've solved in
[Go](https://golang.org/).

Each directory includes a:
- Description with link to LeetCode problem
- Solution to the problem
- A unit test

Note that each of these problems **have passed** their respective test cases on LeetCode. The unit
tests included with each solution in this repo are not comprehensive. They serve as a quick way to
drop in a test case, hook up the debugger, and step through the algorithms to build understanding.

Also note that some of my personal comments are in the solutions. I'll be working to clean up
anything that is not insightful.

## Problems

There are a variety of popular LeetCode problems solved in this repository. However, most of the problems
solved are from a highly recommended, curated list of problems called
[Top 75 LeetCode Problems](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-100-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU).

The [Top 75 LeetCode Problems](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-100-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU)
list is comprehensive, covering a decent breadth and depth for each category. Working through that list will certainly
help build the core concepts, techniques, and intuition needed to solve these types of problems.

I've included a checklist that you can use to work through the list below:
